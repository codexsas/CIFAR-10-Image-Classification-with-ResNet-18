# CIFAR-10-Image-Classification-with-ResNet-18
This project implements image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using a ResNet-18 model with transfer learning techniques. The model is trained using PyTorch, with a focus on data augmentation and performance evaluation.
Features
Transfer Learning: Utilizes a pretrained ResNet-18 model.
Data Augmentation: Random cropping and normalization applied.
Model Evaluation: Outputs test accuracy and visualizes sample predictions.
